5 ways to plan a useful budget

List all your monthly bills and expenses in order of when
they will need to be paid, make a note of these expenses on your phone so you
can account for when they have been successfully paid

Be accurate in description of your costs, if there is a need
to buy a birthday present or another similar gift; ensure the cost of this is
included

Refresh your budget on a monthly basis to ensure any new or
one-off costs are accounted for; this would then make sure you have planned for
the likes of car tax or an MOT

Spread your spare income realistically across the month,
making sure you have adequate funds available at the points in the month you
wish to use them; at the weekends for example

Make sure your budget accounts for an amount allocated to
savings each and every month; you never know when you might need it
